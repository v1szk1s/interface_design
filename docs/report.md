Brief description (200 words is sufficient) of the objectives of the proposed system and the implemented solution.

## A. INTRODUCTION
Description of the chosen problem ("domain analysis") and objectives of the work.
[General description of a scenario (e.g. small business) for the application of your site. Examples:
● Travel agency
● Computer store
● Musical instrument store
● Concert/event booking website
Movie theater
● School/training center
● ...]

## B. USER PROFILE
Description of the users of the proposed system: "who" the users are, identification of their characteristics (e.g. age, physical characteristics, culture, personality, learning and working methods, experience with tools and systems similar to the one proposed), their objectives and motivations, level of knowledge/skills. If there is more than one user group, describe each one.
B.1. PERSONAS
Presentation of the "personas" (2 or 3 personas are enough, representative of the users)

### Persona A
![persona1](https://github.com/v1szk1s/interface_design/blob/main/docs/persona1.png)

### Persona B
![persona2](https://github.com/v1szk1s/interface_design/blob/main/docs/persona2.png)

[Examples in Moodle slides "03 - User Analysis" - you can use persona templates, such as the one available at https://xtensio.com/user-persona/ ]
## C. TASK ANALYSIS
Answers to the 11 questions that characterize the users and their tasks:

1.Who will be using the system (who are our users)?
2. what tasks do they currently perform?
3.What tasks are desirable (new tasks that users will enjoy in the future)?
4.How do users learn to perform tasks?
5.Where are the tasks performed?
6.What are the relationships between users and information?
7. what other instruments/tools does the user require (in order to perform the task)?
8.How do users communicate with each other?
9.Which tasks and functionalities are most frequently performed / used?
10.What time constraints are imposed?
11.What happens if something goes wrong?

## C1. SELECTED TASKS
Description of the tasks selected for implementation in the system (including sub-tasks).
["Chap 4 - Task Analysis" in Moodle]


## C2. ACTIVITY SCENARIOS
["Chap 5 - Usability Requirements" in Moodle]

## D. REQUIREMENTS
["Cap 5 - Usability Requirements" in Moodle]

## E. EVOLUTION OF PROTOTYPES
Description and illustration of the evolution of your prototypes, from the preliminary design of the application (alternative designs), to the functional prototype (on computer), to the low-fidelity prototype (paper prototype). Briefly describe the errors identified in each of the phases, and how the feedback obtained (from the teacher, colleagues, etc.) influenced/changed the ideas and design of the prototypes.
["Chap 8 - Prototypes" on Moodle]


## E1. INTERACTION SCENARIOS
Description of the interaction scenarios, one for each of the tasks chosen.
["Chap 8 - Prototypes" in Moodle]

## E2. LOW-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE (PAPER PROTOTYPE OR ANY DRAWING PROGRAM, INCLUDING POWERPOINT)
Description of the screenshots of the prototypes on paper (or made in a program that allows drawing). Justification of the design choices (suggestion: comment on the elements of the prototypes, justifying "why" and "how" these elements are introduced - buttons, scroll bars, menus, etc).

## E3. FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE (REACT, USING SUPPORT LIBRARIES)
Description of the computer prototype, including screenshots and annotations. Add some instructions on how to "use" the prototype and clearly indicate which tasks and functionalities have been fully implemented and which are just "decorative".
[React will be used.]

## F. CONCLUSIONS
[ Conclusion, with personal reflection ]
Present the main conclusions of the work, what methodologies were used to achieve the objectives, degree of success achieved, difficulties and ideas for next steps in the work.
